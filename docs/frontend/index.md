# Prodcuts Listing Page

- Displaying All Products from Mock Data:
  We have implemented a feature that enables the display of all products available in our mock data. Users can now easily browse through the entire product catalog, providing them with a comprehensive view of our offerings.

- Pagination for Improved Navigation:
  To enhance user experience and prevent issues associated with infinite scrolling, we have introduced pagination functionality. Users can now navigate through the product list more efficiently by moving between different pages, allowing for smoother and more organized browsing.

# Prodcuts Detail Single Page

- Single Page Description for Products:
  We have introduced a feature that offers detailed product descriptions on a single page. Users can now access comprehensive information about each product, including specifications, pricing, and additional details, all in one centralized location. This enhancement aims to provide users with a better understanding of our products, facilitating informed decision-making during their shopping experience.
